# Cox Censor

When raiding with your friends, it is often more fun to hide the loot until
the chest is opened, which forces all players in the raid to go to trade chat
in order to hide the surprise. This relieves players of that inconvenience by
censoring the item received as a drop, allowing everyone to keep the suspense
while also knowing who got a drop. If you would like to see what the drop was, 
simply turn off the plugin. This also works with multiple items in the same raid.
